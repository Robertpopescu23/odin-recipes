        <h2>Lasagna Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese.
            It’s baked until golden and bubbly, creating a hearty meal that’s perfect for family gatherings. 
            Its origins trace back to the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, but it has become a comfort food favorite worldwide.

            <li>500g (1 lb) ground beef</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>800g (28 oz) canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>250g (2 cups) ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>250g (2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>50g (1/2 cup) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15–20 minutes to let the flavors blend.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with the egg until smooth.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place 3 noodles on top.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers twice more: sauce → noodles → ricotta → mozzarella → Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Top the final layer with the remaining sauce and cheeses.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
