# Odin Recipes

## Course Progress

I have completed the **Introduction to HTML** course in The Odin Project.  
In this section, I learned:

- What HTML is and how it is used to build the structure of web pages
- Basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and images
- How a web browser interprets HTML to render content
- The role of HTML in the full-stack development process
- Basic networking concepts, like how a client communicates with a server to request and load HTML documents

This marks the beginning of my journey into full-stack web development.
